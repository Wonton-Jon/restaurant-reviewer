### Features
This project will allow people to create an accound and search for existing restaurants (fast food included but can be filtered our) by rating and type of cuisine. Each user will be able to have their own list of favorite restaurants that they can add or delete from. Each restaurant will show the number of users that have the restaurant saved as well as the reviews of each restaurant. Users can add restaurants that do not currently exist.

This project was made for students new to Santa Cruz that are looking for good food in the area rated by other students. When searching Google for food, the recommended searches are based off of popularity without regard for expense. For example, I like poke, but found it scarce in Santa Cruz county; and all the places recommended were not that good. I was able to find some really good poke that still don't come up when I search for it :/
